# Placeholder for typing sound 1
# This is a placeholder audio file for the juicy editor typing sounds.
# In a real implementation, this would be a .wav or .ogg audio file.
# For now, we'll create this as a text placeholder that will be replaced with actual audio.

# Sound properties:
# - Type: Soft keyboard click
# - Duration: ~50ms
# - Frequency: Mid-range
# - Volume: Moderate
# - Intended use: Regular typing feedback

# To add actual audio:
# 1. Place .wav or .ogg files in this directory
# 2. Import them in Godot
# 3. Reference them in the AudioManager
