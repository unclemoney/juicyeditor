## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### Single Responsibility
Each scene and script has one clear purpose, avoiding monolithic components.

### Signal-Driven Architecture
UI actions emit signals that are handled by appropriate controllers, maintaining loose coupling.

### Configurable Effects
All visual and audio effects can be customized or disabled via settings.

### Self-Contained Components
Scenes are designed to work independently with minimal external dependencies.

### 🚀 Next Phase: Node-Based Juicy Typing Effects (NEW APPROACH)

#### 🔄 **DEPRECATED: RichTextLabel Enhancement Plan**
**⚠️ The hybrid TextEdit + RichTextLabel architecture has been deprecated due to complexity issues in our lightweight editor.**
- The RichTextLabel overlay system proved too complex for reliable maintenance
- BBCode effects, text shadows, outlines, and gradient backgrounds have been disabled
- Visual Effects menu items have been deactivated
- Code remains in project but is disabled for future reference

#### ✨ **NEW: Simplified Node-Based Typing Effects**
Inspired by the [ridiculous_coding](https://github.com/jotson/ridiculous_coding) plugin, we're implementing a much simpler but more fun approach:

**Core Concept: Animated Node Effects**
- **TypingEffect Node2D**: Individual animated characters that spawn when typing
- **TypingEffectsManager**: Coordinates effect spawning and cleanup
- **Simple Label-Based Animations**: Character bounce, fade, color randomization
- **Particle Effects**: Optional particles for extra juiciness
- **Audio Coordination**: Synchronized sound effects with visual feedback

#### 🎯 New Juicy Typing System Features
